description: Plan before implementation when explicitly asked to plan or when substantial architectural choices need resolution. A task spanning multiple files alone does not require this skill.

# Plan

Explore the relevant code before proposing changes.

Keep investigation read-only; do not implement or edit code while planning.
Read-only tools and shell commands are fine. The only permitted writes are to
the plan document (and its directory) when the user has requested or approved
saving or updating it.

Resolve discoverable questions yourself by reading code. Ask the user only when
a material product or architectural decision cannot be inferred.

Produce a concise implementation-ready plan containing (at most):

- Goal and scope
- Important decisions and rationale
- Relevant files/components
- 2–6 implementation units
- Tests / verification
- Material risks or dependencies

Right-size the plan. Simple work gets a simple plan (goal + files + steps);
use the full list only for genuinely complex work.

Write every plan so a weaker model in a fresh chat with zero memory can
implement it: exact file paths, small ordered steps, what "done" looks like
per step, and what NOT to touch. No vague language.

Describe WHAT must change and the important constraints. Do not pre-write
implementation code, exact signatures, or detailed shell command sequences
unless they are necessary to communicate the design.

When complete, show the plan and offer to save it to the project's
`docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`. If saving or updating a plan was already
requested, do it without asking again. Create `docs/plans/` only when saving;
prefix the saved plan with date, original request, working directory, and the
verified branch (or state that it is not a Git repository).

Planning or saving a plan is not approval to implement it. Offer implementation
as the next step and stop pending approval. If the user already explicitly
requested planning followed by implementation, proceed after planning unless
an unresolved decision needs their input.

Delegated planning: a planning subagent returns the plan plus unresolved
decisions to its parent and never saves, edits, or implements — the
owning/main agent handles saving, approval, and any later implementation.
